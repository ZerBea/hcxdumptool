**GitHub is for bugs and features - not for support**
Questions must be posted in the [discussion board](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool/discussions)

**driver bugs**
It's completely useless to report driver bugs here!
I'm not a developer of drivers!
Developers of drivers don't read this here!
The driver will never ever be fixed if you don't report it either to upstream or to [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/)!
